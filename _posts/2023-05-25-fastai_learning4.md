## Choose an Optimal Learning Rate

### Learning rate in a neural network

Learning rate in a neural network refers to a hyperparameter that determines the step size at which the model's parameters are updated during the training process. It controls the magnitude of adjustments made to the weights and biases of the network based on the error calculated by the loss function.

Choosing an appropriate learning rate is important for efficient and effective training. It requires finding a balance between fast convergence and stable learning. Setting an optimal learning rate often involves experimentation and fine-tuning.

If the learning rate is too high, the model might oscillate and fail to converge. If the learning rate is too low, the model might converge very slowly. Techniques such as learning rate schedules, learning rate decay, or adaptive learning rate methods like Adam or RMSprop are often employed to optimize the learning rate during training and improve the convergence of the model.


In fastai, We can directly use fastai's learn.lr_find() method to find the optimal learning rate.

```python
learn.lr_find()
```

Plotting the loss function against the learning rate yields the following figure:

It suggests that a learning rate of approximately 0.00010964782268274575 is recommended for training your model.
